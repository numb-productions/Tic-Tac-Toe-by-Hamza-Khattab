# Tic-Tac-Toe-by-Hamza-Khattab
A custom Tic Tac Toe game to be developed more while I learn.

Hello! This project started as just a fun thing, that I'm willing to gain experience from.
This, along with more games I hope to create, will be updated the more I learn. So stay tuned!

# NOTES #

- The game randomly chooses starting turns
- The game's current slot choice is completely random
- It's so easy to win
- Only supports one human player
- The code is all completely written by me with no external sources, so please careful not to re-use it abusively

# UPDATEs NOTES #

Current version: "1.0"
