# Tic-Tac-Toe-by-Hamza-Khattab
This is a *console Tic Tac Toe game* made in *Python* to
be developed more while I learn. This project started as
just a fun thing, that I'm willing to gain experience from.
This - along with more games I hope to create - will be
updated the more I learn. So stay tuned!

# Notes
- The game randomly chooses starting turns.
- The game's current slot choice is completely random.
- It's so easy to win.
- Only supports one human player.
- `IMPORTANT` The code is all completely written by me with no external sources, so please careful not to re-use it abusively.

# Update Notes
- Current version `1.1`
- Last updated `12/3/2021`
- Added file `README.md`
